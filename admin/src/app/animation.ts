/**
 * Returns a cold observable which, when subscribed, animates the given element using the given animation.
 * The animation's `onStart` method is called on subscription.
 * This `onStart` method is supposed to trigger a CSS animation (typically by adding a CSS class to the element, which defines
 * an animation). Then the duration of the animation is automatically obtained from the element. When the `animationend`
 * DOM event is emitted by the element or, by default (in case the event is never emitted), 20 milliseconds after the
 * scheduled end of the animation, the `onEnd` method of the animation, if any, is called.
 * This `onEnd` method typically removes the CSS class, so that the animation can be re-executed again later.
 * Then, the observable emits and completes to signal the end of the animation.
 * If the returned observable is unsubscribed before it has emitted, the `onEnd` method is also called.
 * @param element the element to animate
 * @param animation the animation to apply on the element
 * @param synchronous if true, then the `onEnd` method of the animation is called synchronously, immediately
 * after the `onStart` method, and the returned observable also emits and completes synchronously.
 * This can be useful in tests, when you do not want the animation to take any time.
 * @return an Observable which emits a single time and then completes, once the animation is done and the `onEnd` method has been
 * called.
