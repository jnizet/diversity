# Backend

This is the project containing the Java source files of the application backend, as well as the 
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org) templates used to generate the HTML pages.

# JavaScript and CSS

The JavaScript and CSS files are generated by the [frontend](../frontend/README.md) project.

During development, it's advised to run `yarn watch` from the frontend directory to generate the JS and
CSS files (see the frontend README for details), and to execute the application using the `dev` profile,
from the root directory. The task `./gradlew bootRun` does that by itself.

This `dev` profile includes the `frontend/build/dist` directory in the list of static resources locations,
so that the JavaScript and CSS files generated by `yarn watch` are available to the templates.

For production, gradle builds the JavaScript and CSS in production mode (minified) and includes
the generated files inside the generated application jar file.

The Spring resource chain is used at runtime in order to rewrite the paths to those files
with a content hash in their name, and to instruct the browser to cache those files.
